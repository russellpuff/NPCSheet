------Wizard Transcript------
>The wizard will guide you through the NPC creation process.
>You can find a copy of everything the wizard tells you in the external documentation.
>
>Begin by deciding the NPC's name, race, alignment, and type.
>If "race" is known by a different term not listed, you can manually type it.
>Alignment is optional as not all systems use it.
>Type has two boxes, the left box is the mandatory creature type, such as Humanoid or Dragon.
>The right box is an optional tag. You see tags in the parenthesis in types such as Humanoid (human). 
>Parenthesis are not required in this context.
>
>When you are ready to proceed to the next step, click the Next button.

>The next step is to fill out the NPC's Languages, Senses, and Statistics.
>Languages and Senses can be added by putting each on a new line. You must have at least one of each.
>Statistics covers any feature of the NPC not covered in future segments. This segment is optional, and you may want to come back to it later.

>The next step is to establish the NPC's ability scores.
>The traditional scores have been implemented by default, but you can use custom scores by unchecking the Use Traditional? checkbox.
>Ability scores can be generated randomly using the 4d6d1 method, click the Roll Random? button to do so.

>The next step is to determine your NPC's hit points, stamina points (if applicable) and initiative bonus.
>If your system uses stamina points, you can enable them with the associated checkbox.
>Make sure you disable stamina if you don't use it, otherwise your NPC will have at least 1 point.

>The next step is to set up your NPC's defenses.
>The default defense type AC has already been set, but you can change this.
>You can add up to two additional defenses using the checkboxes.

>The next step is to establish your NPC's saves and skills.
>Type the name of the Save/Skill in the appropriate box, then set their numerical bonus/detriment.
>A save or skill can be deleted by selecting them in the list, and pressing Delete.
>These segments are optional, if your NPC does not have any save or skills mods.

>The next step is to establish your NPC's Actions, Weapons, and Spells.
>Your NPC only requires one entry in any of the three.
>
>The Actions section allows you to define an Action name in the top box, 
>and the Action's description in the box below it. Click the Add button to add it to the list.
>Actions in the list can be viewed or deleted by selected them and clicking the appropriate button.
>
>The weapons section has its own dedicated weapon creator. Click the Create Weapon button to launch it.
>The weapon creator allows you to define a weapon's Name, Ability Mod, bonus to atk and dmg, and type.
>A Weapon can do up to 2 types of damage, but at least one is required. The Weapon Creator will not let you save unless all required fields are filled out.
>
>Spells can be added by typing the spell name into the appropriate text box, and then incrementing the counter to match the spell's level, levels 0-9 are supported.
>Spells added are displayed sorted by their level, to delete the last spell in a row, select a row and click the Remove Last button

>The next step is to define your NPC's traits and items.
>Trait names are in the topmost textbox, and their descriptions go in the box below.
>Traits can be viewed by selecting them and clicking the View button.
>
>Items can be added by typing in the item's name in the textbox, and incrementing its counter for quantity.
>
>Both of these are optional if your NPC doesn't have anything of note.

>The next step is to establish your NPC's personality and description.
>Begin by describing their Appearance, Personality, and their current Goals/Motives.

>Next, define your NPC's tactics when it comes to Social encounters, Combat encounters, and their morale.

>The final step is to establish your NPC's Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws.
>If you cannot see that segment, try scrolling down.

>Congratulations! You've successfully completed the NPC!
>The entire form is now open to you to make tweaks. When you're finished, click the save button to save your NPC.
